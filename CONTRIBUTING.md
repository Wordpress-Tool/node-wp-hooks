# Contributing

## Workflow

A good workflow is to work directly in this repo, branch off `master`, and
submit your changes as a pull request.

Ideally name your branches with prefixes and descriptions, like this:
`[type]/[change]`. A good prefix would be:

- `add/` = add a new feature
- `try/` = experimental feature, "tentatively add"
- `update/` = update an existing feature

For example, `add/promises-support` means you're working on adding first-class
support for asynchronous filters that return `Promise` objects, as described in
the main readme.
